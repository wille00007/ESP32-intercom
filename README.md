# ESP32-Intercom: Bluetooth A2DP & HFP for iPhone

A high-fidelity Bluetooth audio system using Dual-Profile handshaking (Music & Calls).
📖 Overview

This project implements a dual-profile Bluetooth system on the ESP32, specifically optimized for iPhone integration. It enables high-quality music streaming via A2DP and seamless switching to duplex voice communication via HFP (Hands-Free Profile).

By utilizing digital I2S communication, it bypasses the internal 8-bit DAC of the ESP32 to provide professional-grade audio fidelity for DIY helmet intercoms or hands-free systems.
✨ Key Features

    Dual-Profile Handshaking: Automatic switching between A2DP (Media) and HFP (Voice/Calls).

    Dynamic I2S Clock Scaling: Real-time hardware re-syncing between 44.1kHz (Music) and 16kHz (Wideband Speech).

    Full-Duplex Audio: Simultaneous high-quality speaker output and digital microphone input.

    Persistence: Bluetooth Link Keys stored in NVS (Non-Volatile Storage) for reliable auto-reconnection.

    Latency Debugging: Built-in real-time monitoring of profile transition speeds.

📡 System Status Logs

The firmware provides real-time feedback via the Serial Monitor:

    [STATUS]: Connection handshakes and profile readiness.

    [EVENT]: Profile transitions (e.g., from Media to Voice).

    [LATENCY]: Timing data for profile switching (measured in ms).

    [INFO]: Heartbeat monitor showing current active mode.
